	<h3 style="color:white">Definitions</h3>
  User - Humans who physically play the game
EP - Event Points
GP - Game Points
Tournament - A general category of physics that contains many groups of more specific topics
Tournament Champion - The highest degree of “winning” that a User can achieve
Event - A subcategory within a Tournament wherein specific experiments relating to the subcategory are chosen as “Teams”
 This is where all the points for the game are earned
Preliminary Winners - Users who win Events within a Tournament
Teams - Experiments that are selected by Users
Index - List of Teams that a User chooses for an Event
Game Tree
Game ---> Tournament ---> Event
Game Play Process
Users choose a Tournament they would like to participate in
Users then create an Index for each Event that occurs in the Tournament
Users then attend their Team’s presentation and score the presentation based on the rubric for that Tournament
A User wins an Event by earning the most amount of EP
Winning an Event earns the User 100 GP
The Winners of the Events within a Tournament compare their total GP earned 
Whoever holds the most GP is the Tournament Champion

Tournament Rules/Game Play (Single Winner)

What is a Tournament?
A Tournament is the highest tier, with regards to winning, of the game
It’s a general category of physics within which there are many subcategories (Events)
EXAMPLE:		Neutrino Tournament
The general category is “Neutrino(s)”
Rules of a Tournament
Users must participate in each Event within a Tournament
There may be only one winner for a Tournament
User Restriction
A Tournament must have at least five (5) Users
A Tournament may not have more than ten (10) Users
How is a Tournament won?
A Tournament is won by the User who earns the most amount of GP (assuming no Tie Breaker rounds are required)
Tie Breaker (Amount of GP does not matter here)
Essentially, the Event process (with the exception of attending Team presentations) is repeated between only the preliminary winners
Using the scores obtained from attending the presentations, the Users compare their scores for each Event, and the User whose Team Member, individually, has the highest score wins that event
EXAMPLE:			
Neutrino Tournament
Top Quark Event	      Bottom Quark Event	Strange Quark Event
      User A, Team 1: 10pts	 User A, Team 1: 17pts     User A, Team 1: 13pts
       Team 2: 6pts		   Team 2: 6pts		        Team 2: 21pts 
      User B, Team 1: 13pts       User B, Team 1: 3pts      User B, Team 1: 17pts
        Team 2: 2pts		    Team 2: 19pts	        Team 2: 19pts
User B won the most Events and thus, the Tournament
The preliminary winner who wins the most Events is the Tournament Champion
Tie Breaker is activated, if applicable, until there is only one User left

Event Rules/Game Play

What is an Event?
An Event is the lowest tier, with regards to winning, of the game
It’s the subcategory topics within a general category (Tournament)
EXAMPLE:		Neutrino Tournament
Top Quark Event	Bottom Quark Event
Rules of an Event
Scoring
Scoring will take place digitally and is based on a rubric designed for the Tournament being played
Event Number Restriction
There must be an ODD number of Events in a Tournament
Team Rules
User are restricted in the number Teams allowed to be added to their Index, based on the number of Users and Teams participating in the Event
The number of teams in a User’s Index must be:
 (# of Users) - 2
An Event must have at least 1.5 times the number of Teams per User (# of Teams = (1.5)(# of Users))
When dealing with an odd number of Users, round the number of Teams up to the nearest integer
Indexes within an Event may not be identical
Index likeness is acceptable up to one Team in difference
Okay - User A’s Index: XXXX | User B’s Index: XXXO | User C’s Index: XXXY
Not Okay - User A’s Index: XXXX | User B’s Index: XXXX | User C’s Index: XXXO
How is an Event won?
An Event is won by a User whose cumulative EP is the highest
 Ties
A tie within an event is settled by evenly distributing 100GP to each winner
