Will need an automated random team generator to pit crew against crew

Should be able to trade/bench members 


Physics related: 
	Unlocking things to keep interest all year long 

set of teams exist outside a particular conference/tournament

Hidden Sector --> like Jeopardy "catch-all," misc. 


Quick Fire League for one-shot and an entire "season" 

List of teams outside of league, don't correspond to talks 
  
Promote more universal gameplay 

A demo of gameplay 

Make "about" section longer 

Resources about physics, higgs boson, etc


Rules/Format:

   - in addition to "single tournament", "league"/longer-term gameplay

Presentation/Formatting:

   - more pictures (esp. when explaining rules)


Overall:
   - label for experiments
   - label for categories
